==========
Field List
==========

:what:  Field lists map field names to field bodies, like
        database records.  They are often part of an extension
        syntax.

:how:   The field marker is a colon, the field name, and a
        colon.

        The field body may contain one or more body elements,
        indented relative to the field marker.
